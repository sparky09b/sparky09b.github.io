            temperature) or for notifications about upcoming weather alerts.

            Tori is in college, taking general education classes, but is
            planning to visit one of the three towns for vacation. She is only
            concerned with the weather during her visit, but is looking at the
            site to find what events are happening during her visit. She mostly
            uses her smartphone to surf the web.
